        Foul: \n
        &#8226; You pocket the 8-ball any time during the game before sinking all your balls.\n

    <string name="donation_text">First of all thank you for downloading the app! I hope you get some use out of it.
        \n\nVery brief backstory! Ive had this idea in the back of my mind since my 2nd year of uni in 2019 or so. I learned that going to the pub, playing pool and drinking made it much easier to tolerate people talking to me about computer science.
        I used to play at least five games a day and I tracked my wins and losses against my mates but started to wonder about some more advanced stats, do I win more when I break? am I better with red balls or yellow balls? etc … and here we are!
        \n\nI wanted to make something simple that just did its job and didn\'t need your email address or your mothers maiden name to use.
        \n\nI made this app mostly because I wanted to but also to show to potential employers. With this in mind if you did want to support me, leaving a rating on the play-store would help massively.
        \n\nIf you wanted to chuck a quid my way there is a link below which will take you to my ‘buy me a coffee’ page. Please in no way feel obligated! I wanted this app to be free and not have annoying ads.
        \n\nThanks again and have a good game!</string>
